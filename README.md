HANDDRAW | Python (OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy)

Developed a real-time hand gesture-based drawing application using Python, utilizing OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and NumPy for managing the virtual canvas.
Integrated features like dynamic color palette selection, drawing toggle, and canvas clearing provide an interactive drawing experience based on index finger gestures.
